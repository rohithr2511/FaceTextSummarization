India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule spanned nearly two centuries and involved a wide range of leaders, ideologies, and movements. Starting with the Revolt of 1857, which is considered the first major uprising, Indians continuously resisted British dominance through both violent and non-violent means.

One of the most influential figures in this movement was Mahatma Gandhi, who led the non-violent civil disobedience campaigns such as the Salt March and Quit India Movement. Leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel also played pivotal roles in shaping the freedom movement. The partition of British India in 1947 led to the creation of two independent nations—India and Pakistan—but also resulted in widespread communal violence and displacement.

The legacy of the independence movement remains a cornerstone of Indian identity and continues to influence its political and cultural discourse.

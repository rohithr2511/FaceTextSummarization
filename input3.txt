Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, driven primarily by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. These actions have increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to global warming and extreme weather events. Rising sea levels threaten coastal cities, while droughts and floods disrupt agriculture and water supply.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that limiting global temperature rise to 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels is crucial to avoid catastrophic consequences. This requires immediate and substantial reductions in carbon emissions across all sectors, from energy and transportation to industry and agriculture. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind, combined with energy efficiency measures and carbon capture technologies, are essential to this transition.

Public awareness, international cooperation, and climate justice are vital to ensuring that developing nations receive support in adapting to climate impacts while pursuing sustainable growth.
